# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 3-1-build-year-month-week-day-calendar-views (2026-03-31)

- **F11: `GetWeekRange` duplicated across MainViewModel + four view controls** — DRY violation; extract shared static helper to prevent silent divergence if week-start logic changes. [`ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs`, `Views/WeekViewControl.xaml.cs`]
- **F12: `InitializeAsync` non-atomic `??=` on `_initializationTask`** — hypothetical race; unreachable in practice since WinUI 3 `OnLaunched` runs single-threaded with one call site. [`ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs`]
- **F24: TestData JSON fixtures absent from story diff** — `sample_gcal_events_month.json` and `sample_gcal_events_week.json` exist on disk but were not committed within the reviewed commit range; verify they were committed and contain the correct data described in the story spec.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-10-virtualize-week-view-event-rendering (2026-04-06)

- **`activeSegments` overlap depth unbounded** — Overlap depth grows without cap; deeply-nested overlapping events can push event blocks outside the visible column (collapsed to 1 px width). Pre-existing algorithm carried from old imperative rendering. [`Services/WeekTimedEventProjectionBuilder.cs`]
- **`GetDisplayStart`/`GetDisplayEnd` incorrect for events spanning 3+ calendar days** — For events with `StartLocal.Date != EndLocal.Date`, all segments show the original start/end times rather than per-segment visible times; middle-day segments display misleading labels. Rare in practice (multi-day timed events, not all-day). [`Services/WeekTimedEventProjectionBuilder.cs:125-137`]
- **`currentEvents` `IEnumerable` enumerated 7× per `Rebuild`** — The `Build` method iterates the source once per day (7×); callers currently pass a materialized list so no observable issue, but a LINQ chain or live collection would cause 7 full traversals. [`Services/WeekTimedEventProjectionBuilder.cs`]
- **`ConfigureTimedEventBorder` accesses `Children[0]`/`[1]` without bounds guard** — Assumes `DataTemplate` always produces exactly a `Grid` with 2 children; deviating template changes will throw `IndexOutOfRangeException`. [`Views/WeekViewControl.xaml.cs`]
- **Tapping `WeekHeaderGrid` background clears event selection** — `WeekGrid_Tapped` is also attached to `WeekHeaderGrid`; tapping a day header area without a handled child fires `ClearSelection()` unexpectedly. Pre-existing behavior. [`Views/WeekViewControl.xaml.cs`]
- **`Loaded` handler can double-subscribe `PropertyChanged` on repeated navigation** — `ViewModel.PropertyChanged += ViewModel_PropertyChanged` in `WeekViewControl_Loaded` has no guard; if `Loaded` fires twice without an intervening `Unloaded`, event handlers fire twice per change. Pre-existing pattern. [`Views/WeekViewControl.xaml.cs`]

## Deferred from: code review of 3-11-export-events-to-ics (2026-04-10)

- **Zero-duration timed events produce `DTSTART == DTEND`** — Violates RFC 5545 §3.6.1; Google Calendar never produces zero-duration events so this is unreachable in practice. [`Services/IcsExporter.cs`]
- **Bare `\r` in field values silently deleted rather than escaped** — Mac line-ending edge case; Google Calendar data does not produce bare CR. [`Services/IcsExporter.cs`]
- **`ExportToFileAsync` has no `from <= to` guard at service layer** — Dialog enforces this constraint before calling the service; defensive only. [`Services/IcsExportService.cs`]
- **`DatePicker` pre-fill not guarded against extreme `DateOnly` values** — Defaults always resolve to today or stored event dates, so `MinValue`/`MaxValue` can't be produced. [`Views/MainPage.xaml.cs`]
- **`File.Move` non-atomic across filesystems/network shares** — Mitigated because temp file is placed in the same directory as the destination (same volume). [`Services/IcsExportService.cs`]

## Deferred from: code review of 3-12-import-events-from-ics (2026-04-10)

- **RRULE + malformed DTSTART miscounts as invalid instead of skipped-recurring** — If a VEVENT has both an RRULE and an unparseable DTSTART, early-return in date parsing increments `invalidEventCount` before the post-loop RRULE check fires; the summary shows it as invalid rather than recurring-skipped. Rare edge case; no real-world ICS files exhibit this combination. [`Services/IcsParser.cs:122-139`]
- **`FindValueSeparatorIndex` treats `\:` as escaped colon** — RFC 5545 does not define `\:` as an escape; the guard `line[i-1] != '\\'` is technically incorrect but harmless — `\:` never appears in valid ICS property descriptor lines. [`Services/IcsParser.cs:235-246`]

## Deferred from: code review of 3-9-enhance-year-view-with-event-indicators-and-all-day-previews (2026-04-06)

- **`SpanDays` field populated but unused** — `YearViewPreviewBarDisplayModel.SpanDays` is assigned from `AllDayEventSpan.SpanDays` but no rendering path reads it; if future code uses it, the value reflects the full calendar span of the event, not the clipped visible span. [`Models/YearViewDayDisplayModel.cs:14`]
- **Test `Build_CollapsesMultiDayAssignmentsIntoSingleWeekSegments` validates unused output** — The test asserts `projection.MultiDaySegmentsByWeekStart` but the view uses `BuildWeekSegments` instead; test provides no coverage of the actual rendered output. [`GoogleCalendarManagement.Tests/Unit/Services/YearViewDayProjectionBuilderTests.cs:118`]
- **No test for carry-forward starting before the visible date range** — All tests seed events whose `StartDay` is within `visibleDates`; there is no coverage for a multi-day event that starts before Jan 1 and extends into the visible year. [`GoogleCalendarManagement.Tests/Unit/Services/YearViewDayProjectionBuilderTests.cs`]
- **Zero-duration all-day events silently promoted to single-day** — `BuildAllDaySpans` treats `EndLocal == StartLocal` as SpanDays=1; a malformed/API-edge event gets shown as a valid 1-day bar. [`Services/YearViewDayProjectionBuilder.cs:163-167`]
- **Inverted-date all-day events silently clamped without logging** — When `EndLocal < StartLocal`, the guard clamps `endDay = startDay` silently; a log warning would help diagnose corrupted event data. [`Services/YearViewDayProjectionBuilder.cs:168-170`]

## Deferred from: code review of delete-ux-auto-stage-candidate-undo-toast (2026-05-13)

- **`DeleteUneditedDraftAsync` has no undo** — Called in multiple places to silently discard unedited new drafts with no confirmation or recovery. Inconsistent with the new candidate-delete undo toast. [`ViewModels/EventDetailsPanelViewModel.cs` ~line 1902]
- **`DeleteEventByIdAsync` still shows a confirmation dialog for Pending events** — Programmatic delete path has a different UX than the user-initiated `DeleteEventAsync`. [`ViewModels/EventDetailsPanelViewModel.cs` ~line 1812]
- **`RevertPendingChangesForEventAsync` silently deletes pending edits** — No undo offered when reverting a pending edit via the three-choice dialog. Pre-existing behaviour. [`ViewModels/EventDetailsPanelViewModel.cs` ~line 1880]
