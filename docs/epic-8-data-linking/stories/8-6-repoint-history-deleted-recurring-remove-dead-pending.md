# Story 8.6: Repoint History / Deleted / Recurring; Remove Dead Pending Code

**Epic:** 8 — Event Model & Raw Data Linking Engine
**Status:** ready-for-dev
**Agent:** Opus · **Effort:** medium
**Dependencies:** 8.4 (blocking — sync reconciler uses `event` table), 8.5 (blocking — rendering + drilldowns use `event` table; `IPendingEventRepository` removed from most consumers)

---

## Story

As a developer completing the Epic 8 Phase 0 cleanup,
I want to ensure `gcal_event_version`, `deleted_event`, and recurring-series references all resolve via `event_id`, and to delete every remaining `PendingEvent*` code path that became dead after 8.2–8.5,
so that the entire codebase uses only the stable `event_id` for history, deletion records, and recurring linkage, with no trace of the old `pending_event` table or its service layer remaining.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Version history queryable by `event_id`:** `gcal_event_version.event_id` (FK → `event.event_id`) is the definitive FK; `GcalEventVersion.EventId` is the C# property used by all callers. Any remaining `GcalEventId` property on `GcalEventVersion` is removed; the index `idx_version_event` covers `(event_id, created_at)`.
2. **Delete flow intact:** `deleted_event` has an `event_id` column (string, nullable initially, then non-null for new rows); deletion paths write `event_id`; the delete flow produces correct snapshots with the stable `event_id` preserved. `gcal_event_id` is retained on `deleted_event` as a read-only audit column — it is **not** removed.
3. **Recurring instances resolve:** `event.recurring_event_id` (GCal series string FK → `recurring_event_series.series_id`) is intact; an index exists on `event.recurring_event_id`. No code tries to repoint this to a local `event_id` — the GCal-id-based relationship is correct and deliberate.
4. **No `pending_event` references remain:** The `PendingEvent` entity class, `PendingEventConfiguration`, the `PendingEvents` DbSet, `PendingEventRepository`/`IPendingEventRepository`, and `PendingEventPublishService`/`IPendingEventPublishService` are all deleted. Their DI registrations and test classes are also deleted.
5. **`PendingEventDraftService` survives but is clean:** `PendingEventDraftService` and `IPendingEventDraftService` are kept (they now create `Event` rows and have no `PendingEvent` entity imports). The name is not changed in this story (cosmetic rename deferred to 8.16).
6. `CalendarQueryService` queries only `context.Events`; no join to `context.PendingEvents`.
7. The app compiles and the full test suite passes.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Finalize `GcalEventVersion.EventId` FK (AC: #1)
  - [ ] 1.1 Search `Data/Entities/GcalEventVersion.cs` for `GcalEventId` property — if it still exists, rename it to `EventId`; update `GcalEventVersionConfiguration.cs` FK to `HasForeignKey(v => v.EventId)` pointing at `event.event_id`
  - [ ] 1.2 Search for any caller of `version.GcalEventId` (services, tests) and update to `version.EventId`
  - [ ] 1.3 Verify or create migration to rename `gcal_event_id` column → `event_id` on `gcal_event_version` table and update the index `idx_version_event` to `(event_id, created_at)` — **only needed if 8.2/8.4 left the column rename to this story**; check migration history first to avoid duplicate migration

- [ ] Task 2: Add `event_id` to `deleted_event` via EF migration (AC: #2)
  - [ ] 2.1 Add nullable `string? EventId` property to `Data/Entities/DeletedEvent.cs`; configure `deleted_event.event_id` column in `DeletedEventConfiguration.cs` (no FK constraint — `deleted_event` is a tombstone table; cascades are undesirable)
  - [ ] 2.2 Add EF migration: `ALTER TABLE deleted_event ADD COLUMN event_id TEXT`; backfill: `UPDATE deleted_event SET event_id = (SELECT event_id FROM event WHERE gcal_event_id = deleted_event.gcal_event_id)` — rows where the event no longer exists (already cascaded) will remain NULL; that is acceptable
  - [ ] 2.3 Do **not** remove `gcal_event_id` from `deleted_event` — it is the GCal audit field, not redundant

- [ ] Task 3: Update delete-flow write paths to set `event_id` (AC: #2)
  - [ ] 3.1 Search for all code that writes to `deleted_event` / `context.DeletedEvents` (post-8.4 this is inside the `EventRepository` or a deletion helper written in 8.3/8.4 — verify the exact callsite)
  - [ ] 3.2 Where a `DeletedEvent` row is constructed, set `EventId = event.EventId` (use the stable `event_id` from the `event` row being deleted)
  - [ ] 3.3 Verify `DeletedAt` and `DeletionSource` fields are still populated as before (no behavioral regression)

- [ ] Task 4: Verify recurring-series index and FK integrity (AC: #3)
  - [ ] 4.1 Confirm `event.recurring_event_id` column exists (migrated from `gcal_event` in 8.2); confirm `RecurringEventSeries.SeriesId` is still the GCal-series-id PK
  - [ ] 4.2 Confirm index `idx_gcal_recurring` (or equivalent) exists on `event.recurring_event_id` — add migration to create it if missing
  - [ ] 4.3 **Do NOT** attempt to repoint `recurring_event_id` to local `event_id` — this FK is intentionally GCal-id-based; see Dev Notes §Recurring

- [ ] Task 5: Search and remove all remaining `PendingEvent` entity usages (AC: #4)
  - [ ] 5.1 Run: `grep -rn "PendingEvent\b\|pending_event\|IPendingEventRepository\|IPendingEventPublishService" --include="*.cs"` — collect every hit outside of `PendingEventDraftService.cs` and `IPendingEventDraftService.cs` (those survive)
  - [ ] 5.2 For each hit: confirm it is truly dead (the operation is now handled by `IEventRepository` or another 8.3–8.5 service), then remove it

- [ ] Task 6: Delete `PendingEventRepository` (AC: #4)
  - [ ] 6.1 Delete `Services/PendingEventRepository.cs`
  - [ ] 6.2 Delete `Services/IPendingEventRepository.cs`

- [ ] Task 7: Delete `PendingEventPublishService` (AC: #4)
  - [ ] 7.1 Delete `Services/PendingEventPublishService.cs`
  - [ ] 7.2 Delete `Services/IPendingEventPublishService.cs`
  - [ ] 7.3 If `PendingPublishItemViewModel.cs` depended exclusively on `IPendingEventPublishService`, delete it too; otherwise update it to use the new publish path from 8.3

- [ ] Task 8: Delete `PendingEvent` entity and configuration (AC: #4)
  - [ ] 8.1 Delete `Data/Entities/PendingEvent.cs`
  - [ ] 8.2 Delete `Data/Configurations/PendingEventConfiguration.cs`
  - [ ] 8.3 Remove `public DbSet<PendingEvent> PendingEvents { get; set; }` from `Data/CalendarDbContext.cs`

- [ ] Task 9: Remove DI registrations (AC: #4)
  - [ ] 9.1 In `App.xaml.cs`: remove `services.AddSingleton<IPendingEventRepository, PendingEventRepository>()`
  - [ ] 9.2 In `App.xaml.cs`: remove `services.AddSingleton<IPendingEventPublishService, PendingEventPublishService>()`
  - [ ] 9.3 Verify `IPendingEventDraftService` / `PendingEventDraftService` registration is **kept** (this service survived 8.5)

- [ ] Task 10: Delete `PendingEvent` test classes (AC: #4, #7)
  - [ ] 10.1 Delete `GoogleCalendarManagement.Tests/Integration/PendingEventRepositoryTests.cs` (or its 8.5-successor name) — this file previously tested the old `PendingEvent` table CRUD and the old publish flow
  - [ ] 10.2 Delete `GoogleCalendarManagement.Tests/Integration/PendingEventPublishServiceTests.cs`
  - [ ] 10.3 Verify `PendingEventDraftServiceTests.cs` is **kept** (it was updated in 8.5 to test `CreateCandidateAsync` via `IEventRepository` — it is still valid)

- [ ] Task 11: Compile and test (AC: #7)
  - [ ] 11.1 `dotnet build` — fix every compile error; use the build error list as the complete checklist of remaining `PendingEvent` references
  - [ ] 11.2 `dotnet test` — all tests must pass; a test failure here means a live code path was removed that should have been kept or migrated

## Dev Notes

### What prior stories left for 8.6

By the time this story starts:

- **8.2** created the unified `event` table, merged `gcal_event` + `pending_event` into it, and dropped both source tables. `GcalEventVersion.EventId` may have been renamed from `GcalEventId` in this migration, or it was marked TODO for 8.4.
- **8.3** created `IEventRepository` + `IEventIdentityService`; all event CRUD now goes through `event_id`. Rewrote the publish logic (previously in `PendingEventPublishService`) to operate on `Event` entities.
- **8.4** rewrote `SyncManager` to use `context.Events`; deleted `IGcalEventRepository` / `GcalEventRepository`; confirmed or completed `GcalEventVersion.EventId` rename (Task 4 — "only if not done in 8.2").
- **8.5** rewrote `CalendarQueryService` to read only from `context.Events`; removed `IPendingEventRepository` injection from `EventDetailsPanelViewModel` and most drilldown VMs; updated `PendingEventDraftService` to use `IEventRepository` (return type changed from `PendingEvent` to `Event`).

**What 8.6 is NOT responsible for:**
- Creating any new functionality — this is cleanup only.
- Renaming service/interface names that still contain "Pending" (`IPendingEventDraftService` → `IEventDraftService`) — that is 8.16's job.
- Adding `data_point` table or any Phase 1 work — that starts at 8.7.
- Creating any formal `link` rows for `TogglEntry.PublishedGcalEventId` / `TogglEntry.LinkedEventId` — those become `link` table rows in 8.12; for now the column rename to `PublishedEventId` (if needed after 8.2 dropped `gcal_event`) may be done here if the FK is broken, or deferred to 8.7 if it's tolerated as a nullable orphan.

### `GcalEventVersion.EventId` — may already be done

Task 4 of story 8.4 says "Update `GcalEventVersion` entity to use `EventId` FK — only if not done in 8.2." When you pick up 8.6:

1. Open `Data/Entities/GcalEventVersion.cs` — if the property is already `EventId` and the configuration already references `event.event_id`, Task 1 is a no-op.
2. If `GcalEventId` is still present, complete the rename now and create the EF migration (Task 1.3).

Do not create a migration that was already created. Check `Data/Migrations/` history first.

### `deleted_event` — tombstone semantics

`deleted_event` is a tombstone table: when an event is hard-deleted (or a GCal delete is received), a snapshot row is written. It is **not** a FK-constrained child of `event` — the `event` row itself may be gone by the time you query `deleted_event`. Therefore:

- `event_id` column has **no FK constraint** (do not add `HasForeignKey`).
- `gcal_event_id` is kept as-is — it was always denormalized for GCal audit purposes.
- New rows written after this story should set both `EventId` (the stable id) and `GcalEventId` (if the event had one).

### Recurring events — GCal-id FK is intentional

`event.recurring_event_id` holds the GCal id of the recurring series template (e.g. `"_6t1jce1m6os3ib9o6krjib9k6..."`) — not a local `event_id`. This is the same value Google Calendar uses to group instances. The FK `event.recurring_event_id → recurring_event_series.series_id` is correct and intentional.

Do **not** try to repoint this to a local `event_id`. The open design question ("recurring instances link independently or as a unit") is deferred per concepts.md §10 item 6 — it will be addressed when Story 4.9 (recurring event editing) is tackled.

### `PendingEventPublishService` was rewritten in 8.3

Story 8.3 rewrote the publish logic to operate on `Event` objects (publish fills `gcal_event_id`, sets `publish='published'`). By 8.6, `PendingEventPublishService` may:

- **Still contain `PendingEvent` references** if 8.3 only partially migrated it — delete those and the class if the publish path is fully inside `EventRepository` or another service.
- **Be completely rewritten** by 8.3 to only use `Event` — in that case, delete the class if it is now an empty wrapper.

The litmus test: does `PendingEventPublishService` still import `using ... .Entities.PendingEvent` or query `context.PendingEvents`? If yes, it is still dead code from the old model and must be cleaned up. If it was made clean in 8.3, just delete the file (its logic lives in `EventRepository` now).

### `TogglEntry.PublishedGcalEventId` — check FK integrity

`TogglEntry` has a `PublishedGcalEventId` column (FK → old `gcal_event.gcal_event_id`). After 8.2 dropped `gcal_event`, this FK is broken at the schema level. Depending on how 8.2 handled it:

- If 8.2 migration dropped the FK constraint but kept the column: rename the column to `published_event_id` in this story (since `event.event_id` is now the stable key), add a soft FK note in the configuration, and backfill `published_event_id = (SELECT event_id FROM event WHERE gcal_event_id = toggl_entry.published_gcal_event_id)`.
- If it was already renamed in 8.2 or 8.3: no action needed here.
- If neither: include a migration in this story.

This column will eventually be superseded by the formal `link` table (Epic 8.12), but for now it serves as a direct reference for Toggl drill-down "which event did I approve for this entry?"

### Test deletion scope

Delete the following test files **completely** — they tested the old `pending_event` table CRUD and the old publish pipeline:
- `PendingEventRepositoryTests.cs`
- `PendingEventPublishServiceTests.cs`

Keep:
- `PendingEventDraftServiceTests.cs` — this was updated in 8.5 to test `CreateDraftAsync` (→ `Event` with `lifecycle=approved`) and `CreateCandidateAsync`; it is still valid and live.

### Build errors as your checklist

After deleting the entity and configuration files in Tasks 6–8, run `dotnet build`. Every compile error is a caller that was missed in Task 5. Work through the full error list before running tests.

### Project structure notes

**Files confirmed deleted:**
- `Data/Entities/PendingEvent.cs`
- `Data/Configurations/PendingEventConfiguration.cs`
- `Services/PendingEventRepository.cs`, `Services/IPendingEventRepository.cs`
- `Services/PendingEventPublishService.cs`, `Services/IPendingEventPublishService.cs`
- `GoogleCalendarManagement.Tests/Integration/PendingEventRepositoryTests.cs`
- `GoogleCalendarManagement.Tests/Integration/PendingEventPublishServiceTests.cs`

**Files that may be deleted (check first):**
- `ViewModels/PendingPublishItemViewModel.cs` — if it exclusively wraps `IPendingEventPublishService`; if it was updated to use the new publish path in 8.3, keep it

**Files modified:**
- `Data/CalendarDbContext.cs` — remove `DbSet<PendingEvent>`
- `App.xaml.cs` — remove DI registrations for `IPendingEventRepository`, `IPendingEventPublishService`
- `Data/Entities/GcalEventVersion.cs` — rename `GcalEventId` → `EventId` if not already done
- `Data/Configurations/GcalEventVersionConfiguration.cs` — update FK if not already done
- `Data/Entities/DeletedEvent.cs` — add `EventId` property
- `Data/Configurations/DeletedEventConfiguration.cs` — add `event_id` column config
- New migration in `Data/Migrations/` — covers: `deleted_event.event_id` column, any remaining `gcal_event_version` column rename, `event.recurring_event_id` index (if missing), optional `toggl_entry` column rename
