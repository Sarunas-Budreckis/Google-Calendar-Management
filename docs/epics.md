## Overview

This document provides the complete epic and story breakdown for Google Calendar Management, decomposing the requirements from the [PRD](./PRD.md) into implementable stories.

### Epic Summary

This project is decomposed into **10 epics** that deliver incremental value, starting with foundation and building toward the complete life-review ritual experience.

**Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure** - Establish technical foundation (project setup, database, OAuth)
**Epic 2: Google Calendar Integration & Sync** - Connect to and control Google Calendar
**Epic 3: Calendar UI & Visual Display** - Single-pane view with event interaction
**Epic 4: Data Source Integrations** - Consolidate Toggl, Calls, YouTube, Outlook
**Epic 5: Data Processing & Coalescing Algorithms** - Intelligent automation (8/15 rounding, coalescing)
**Epic 6: Approval Workflow & Publishing** - The satisfying life-review ritual
**Epic 7: Date State & Progress Tracking** - Track completion, know where you left off
**Epic 8: Save/Restore & Version Management** - Safety net, never lose data
**Epic 9: Import Workflows & Data Management** - Effortless ingestion and backup
**Epic 10: Polish & Production Readiness** - Delightful, reliable daily experience

**Sequencing Strategy:** Foundation → Core Calendar → Data Sources → Processing → Approval Workflow → Advanced Features → Polish

Each epic contains 3-8 bite-sized stories designed for single-session completion by development agents.
